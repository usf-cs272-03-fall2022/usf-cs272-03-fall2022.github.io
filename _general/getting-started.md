## Lecture Sections

Lectures will be conducted either in-person or remote by the instructor (see below). All lectures will be recorded and may be viewed asynchronously by students within 48 hours. Students may also attend in-person lectures synchronously via Zoom as a non-interactive backup option if temporarily unable to make it to class in person. The lecture sections and details are:

| Section | Date/Time | Location | Zoom Meeting |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272-03 Lecture | Weds 4:35pm – 6:20pm | Cowell Hall 417 | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
| CS 272-03 Lecture | Fri 4:25pm – 6:20pm	 | Zoom Only | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

Students must attend their enrolled lecture section for exams, unless otherwise approved  by the instructor. Room permitting, students may attend either lecture section (offered by the same instructor) on non-exam days.

Students must attend a lecture section offered by the same instructor as their lab section.

## Lab Sessions

Labs will be conducted in-person by the instructor during the first several weeks of class. During this time, students must attend their enrolled section in-person; labs are not always recorded or available via Zoom. 

| Section | Date/Time | Location | Zoom Meeting |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272L-03 Lab    | Fri 3:15pm – 4:20pm | Zoom | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

After several weeks, the lab sessions transition to one-on-one code reviews with the instructor and optional help sessions led by the teacher assistants.

Students must enroll in and attend a lab section taught by the same instructor as their lecture section.
